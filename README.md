# OpenMap Local SVG Maps

This repo contains the scripts I used to create an SVG map of SE London which I then plotted using an Axidraw. There's a blog post about it [here](https://www.jamesrcroft.com/2018/03/axidraw-plot-of-se-london/).

It uses data from the [OS OpenMap Local](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-map-local.html) dataset.

An example of the SVG output can be seen [here](https://github.com/crofty/openmap-local-svg-maps/blob/master/example/se-london.svg).
